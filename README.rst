Portable Permission Controller
==============================

This is a library to provide the permission control on resources in serverless environment.

When implementing applications using existing frameworks, you can manage user permissions on resources using the module they provide,
but they are not available when you implement applications using serverless computing like AWS Lambda.

This is a very simple permission control library to manage user permissions based on their privileges.
